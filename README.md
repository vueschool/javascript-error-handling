## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).


## Project Setup

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

2. Install projects dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

3. Run the development server

```sh
npm run dev
```

4. Visit site at the url output in the terminal (probabaly [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/))


> ðŸ’¡ if you see any errors in the terminal/console but can still access the site, don't worry about it. These errors occur because we split the code into before and after files, meaning some of the before files have some intentional errors introduce that we discuss during the related lesson.

## Project Structure

Each lesson has it's own before and after files for both the related html and the related javascript. 

For example, to follow along with the second lesson in this course: JavaScript Exceptions, Errors, and Try Catch, you would start in these files:

* `/2-begin.html`
* `/src/2-begin.js`

And in order to see the end state of what the code looks like at the end of the video lesson you could view:

* `2-end.html`
* `/src/2-end.js`
